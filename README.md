# ML-Text-Classification-with-fastText
Classifying products into product categories with the fastText machine learning library. [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/support.html) is a library for efficient learning of word representations and sentence classification.

## Results
After tuning the modek, the precision reached 81.01%. I think a precision of 81.01% is pretty good for my first time working with a classification model, though it can definitely be improved. For next time, I will look more into the different parameters and work on hyperparameter tuning for my models. Overall, I think fastText is a fairly nice and easy library to perform text classification on; however, the data used needs to be cleaned and formatted for fastText, which may take a while.
